                In 2020, the film industry was one of many industries shuttered by COVID-19 lockdowns.
                Theaters closed worldwide, box office revenue plummeted, and major studios were forced to rethink distribution strategies. 
                One of the most significant shifts during this period was the increase in direct-to-streaming releases, as platforms such as Netflix 
                grew massively. This change not only altered how audiences consumed films but also raised questions about the long-term role of theatrical releases.
                Today, more than five years since the initial shutdowns, has the industry recovered?

                This analysis explores weekly box office revenue before and after the pandemic to assess whether the film industry has rebounded, 
                or if it is still navigating a permanently altered landscape.

                We'll focus on domestic box office revenue for the United States.
